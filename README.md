# Super-Store-sales Dashboard

Case Study A superstore retail business is a large, multi-department store that sells various products, including groceries, electronics, home goods, clothing, and more. These stores are often designed to be a one-stop shop for customers, offering a wide range of products and services under one roof. 

Superstores are typically larger than traditional retail stores and may have a larger product selection. Superstores are often part of a larger chain and have multiple locations in a region or country. 

A new store manager needs your help to better understand his/her Data Operations Team. You are provided with part of the sales data that a Business Intelligence Analyst encounters daily. Design the dashboard to analyze and interpret the data to help provide valuable insights to the store manager.
